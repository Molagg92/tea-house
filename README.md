# _Tea-House_

#### By _Erik Zambrano_

#### _This is a small React Applicaton that tracks the weight of a list of Tea products a user can enter_

## Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* React
* NPM
* HTML/CSS

## Description

_This was a mostly an excersize in what I have learned about JSX and React, a user can enjoy full CRUD with the list of coffee products, and thankfully there are no buggs that keep the application back, it works as intended_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Open your terminal and CD into the Desktop or main directory_
* _`git clone https://github.com/Molagg92/tea-house.git` this command will clone this project on your machine, this is the link to my presonal repo from Github_
* _`npm run install` will get the packages needed to run the program_
* _After a few minutes, it will finish, finally you will run the command `npm run start`_

## Known Bugs
_At the moment, there are no know bugs, if any are discovered, please send your comments to `e92zambrano@outlook.com`_


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

_Runs the app in the development mode._\
_Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser._

_The page will reload when you make changes._\
_You may also see any lint errors in the console._

### `npm run build`

_Builds the app for production to the `build` folder._\
_It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance._

_The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes._\
_Your app is ready to be deployed!_

_See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information._

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

_If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project._

_Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own._

_You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it._
